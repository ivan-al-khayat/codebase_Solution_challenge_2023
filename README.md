to test the changing of NDVI value for all the zones try to simply click in this endpoint https://us-central1-fire-watch-380812.cloudfunctions.net/setFakeNdvis , that will trigger an http request [using preferrably the get method] to that webservice. notice that, since NDVI values are randomly generated it's not guaranteed that each time that a number is generated there will be a 20% difference between the current and the previously generated one; in that case the entire pipeline won't be activated, and you need to make a new request by re-clicking to that url.
To be sure that the system is working as expected, after visiting the endpoint, wait 2 minutes to let the system run; if it doens't work it's very likely that the generated random numbers do not exceed the 20% threashold compared to the previous values, therefore you'll need to re-click the endpoint as stated above.

The code for the android app is present in the file fire_watch_native_android.zip.

indications on how to test our system:
1- from the app side start by installing the app on a device, virtual or physical ,(preferrably API 29) and select the rescuer role;
2- select any area you want;
3- on a PC, visit the following endpoint https://us-central1-fire-watch-380812.cloudfunctions.net/setFakeNdvis to fire an alarm;
4- receive the notification of possible fire detected;
5- press the manage button for the new alert that you can find in the "alerts" section identified by the current date;
6- set the status to solving;
7- receive the notification of status update;
8- press again the manage button to set the status of the alert to solved;
9- receive the notification of status solved;
10- verify that the manage button is not clickable, and the test is finished.




As a next step we plan to present the app in Flutter, and we alredy started prototyping it; it available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I-tP9-Y9-1NGVoR6gVTU4C4FADqtTZdA/view to better design the user interface.
As further improvements we plan to implement a machine learning model that enhance the fire detection strategy; for this task we have uploaded in this repo the file FirePredictionDaraset_Cleaned_World_NASA_FIRMS_24.03.2023.csv to possibily train the model.
Also we plan to add an authentication method for the user that will be qualified as a rescuer, where more information can be found inside the file Authentication.zip
