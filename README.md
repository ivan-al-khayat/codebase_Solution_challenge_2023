to test the changing of NDVI value for all the zones try to simply click in this endpoint https://us-central1-fire-watch-380812.cloudfunctions.net/setFakeNdvis , that will trigger an http request [using preferrably the get method] to that webservice. notice that, since NDVI values are randomly generated it's not guaranteed that each time that a number is generated there will be a 20% difference between the current and the previously generated one; in that case the entire pipeline won't be activated, and you need to make a new request by re-clicking to that url.
To be sure that the system is working as expected, after visiting the endpoint, wait 2 minutes to let the system run; if it doens't work it's very likely that the generated random numbers do not exceed the 20% threashold compared to the previous values, therefore you'll need to re-click the endpoint as stated above.
